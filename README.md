# Assumptions & limitations

- We won't use a persistent database for the purpose of this challenge.
- We'll use purchase dates to uniquely identify inventory batches for the purpose of simplification.
- Transactions can be added in a random order (e.g. whenever a Purchase / Sale happens, or all Purchases first and Sales later, etc).
